Teach yourself the basics of SASS and SCSS through simple coding exercises.



## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from nodejs.org/download
Install learn-sass with npm

Open your terminal and run this command:

npm install -g learn-sass

The -g or --global option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.
Having issues with installation?

If you get an EACCESS error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

sudo npm install -g learn-sass

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use sudo. Have a look at the npm documentation.
